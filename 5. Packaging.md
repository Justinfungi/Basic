### Method 1 pyinstaller
pyinstaller image_exif.py

        1. build/ directory:
            This directory contains intermediate files generated during the build process, such as compiled temporary files.
These files are <span style="color:red">no longer needed</span> after the packaging is complete, so they can be safely deleted.

        2. Deleting the build/ directory will not affect the final executable file.
            dist/ directory:
            This directory contains the final executable file, which is the product you need to distribute and deploy.
        
<span style="color:red">Do not delete this directory or the executable file within it</span>, as they are the final output of your application.

        3. image_exif.spec file:
            This file records the <font color="red">red</font>detailed configuration information of the packaging process, and can be used to further customize the packaging process.
            If you do not need to customize the packaging process, you can choose to delete this file.
            However, if you need to repackage the application in the future, it is best to keep this file to reuse the configuration.


### Method 2

Files:

        /path/image_exif.pyx
        setup.py

```
#Setup.py
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    name="Image EXIF",
    ext_modules=cythonize("image_exif.pyx"),
)
```

Command

        python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Output:

        /path/image_exif.c
        /path/image_exif.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so

Import:

        import sys
        sys.path.append('path')
        import image_exif (the file as the lib)
        image_exif.add_meta() # Attribute function
