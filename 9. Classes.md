# Details:
__getitem__(self, i):

Function: Allows instances of a class to use square bracket notation to retrieve items (e.g., object[i]).
Usage: Used to implement container-like behavior where objects can be accessed by index.

__len__(self):

Function: Returns the length of the object when len() function is called on it.
Usage: Enables the object to support the len() function, allowing you to get the length of the object.

__iter__(self):
Function: Returns an iterator object. It enables objects to be iterated over (e.g., in a for loop).
Usage: Allows instances of the class to be used in iteration contexts, like with for item in object.

__contains__(self, key):
Function: Checks if a given key is present in the object.
Usage: Determines if a specific value exists within the object, often used with the in keyword.

__str__(self):
Function: Returns a string representation of the object when str() is called on it.
Usage: Provides a human-readable representation of the object when converted to a string, often useful for debugging and logging.
